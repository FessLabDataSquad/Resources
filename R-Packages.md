1. gather(): reformats the data from wide to long 
2. separate(): splits a single variable into two variables
3. unite(): merges two variables into a single variable
4. spread(): reformats the data from long to wide

#### Discusses the following dplyr functions: 
1. select(): selects desired variables for your current task
2. filter(): selects observations with matching conditions
3. group_by(): groups data by categorical variables
4. summarise(): performs initial summary statistics
5. arrange(): order variable values in ascending or descending order
6. join(): joins two datasets together (see: http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html)
